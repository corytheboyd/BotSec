BotSec version 0.1.1

Welcome!

This is my my final project for a Flash Game Programming class, but maybe I'll add more to it after that.

The game is definitely a work in progress, and I'm sure its full of inefficiency and WTF, but DEAL WITH IT HOMIE!

TODO:
-Main menu
-Guns and melee weapons
-Doors
-Moving platforms
-Popup notifications, like when picking up new item
-Weapon rotation
-Pause menu functionality
	-inventory
	-equip slots or something like that
	-minimap
-Plenty of other things as I find them

CHANGLOG:
[0.1.1] - Added support for arbitrary items, but need to create references in GC first.
[0.1.0] - Initial release.
