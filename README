BotSec version 0.1.1

Welcome!

This is my my final project for a Flash Game Programming class, but maybe I'll add more to it after that.
The game is definitely a work in progress, and I'm sure its full of inefficiency and WTF, but DEAL WITH IT HOMIE!

TODO:
-Add an action button. used to open doors, etc.
-Ability to unlock door remotely
-Preserve player velocity when switching tiles
-Main menu
-Moving platforms
-Weapon rotation
-Pause menu functionality
	-inventory
	-equip slots or something like that
	-minimap
-Plenty of other things as I find them
