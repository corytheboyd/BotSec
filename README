BotSec version 0.1

Welcome!

This is my my final project for a Flash Game Programming class, but maybe I'll add more to it after that.

The game is definitely a work in progress, and I'm sure its full of inefficiency and WTF, but DEAL WITH IT HOMIE!

TODO:
-Guns and melee weapons.
-Weapon rotation
-Ability to create items from arbitrary string values (assuming that there are matching Class definitions)
-Pause menu functionality
	-inventory
	-equip slots or something like that
	-minimap
-Plenty of other things as I find them

CHANGLOG:
[0.1] -Initial release
